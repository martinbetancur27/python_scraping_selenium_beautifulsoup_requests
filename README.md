# Python: scraping with Selenium, Requests and BeautifulSoup. Three modules with object-oriented programming. It has a module to scrape a dynamic page.
    

The user_logic_test.py module contains logic that creates a user experience to test scraping.


Choose a static or dynamic page (infinite scroll) and different methods to filter the information.


Copy the modules in your project to have access to Selenium, BeutifulSoup and Requests, in addition to having established methods to filter the data.

You can review the program logic at the following link:

Clarifications!
=============

- Review the robots.txt file of the page you will scrape. THE CONTENT IS NOT YOURS.
Example: https://hipertextual.com/robots.txt

- When scraping a dynamic web some data may be lost; consider. If you get little data in static scraping, try dynamic scraping.

- At replit.com I made some changes to the replit code and configuration to be able to run the Selenium package.
Source of the changes you make: https://replit.com/talk/ask/Can-I-use-selenium/11566

- In replit run the module main.py

- You can't test dynamic pages in replit because replit overlays the graphical interface and hides the console, making it impossible to see the progress of the program.
